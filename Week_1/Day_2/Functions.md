# 5 rules for good functions:

1. Give functions precise verb names (no passive language here!)
2. Use `camelCase`
3. Properly indent the functions code
4. Functions should focus on one task: either returning a value or causing a side effect of some kind. Break the function into 
additional other functions if it's doing two or more things. 
5. Data needed by Functions should be passed as an argument directly to the function, rather than being directly accessed from a global variable. SCOPE!
