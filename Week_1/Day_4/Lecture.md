## Functions

Functions are first class citizens. They can be treated like any other value in Javascript.

PAssing a function into a function is known as a Callback.
Higher ORder Function takes a callback.

Inline callbacks, good for one-time-use functions. If you want to use that function in multiple places then you should define it.

CAllback functions can have ANY number of arguments (like forEach having value, index, array)
